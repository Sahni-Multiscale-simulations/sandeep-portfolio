      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am currently working as a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of Mechanical & Materials Engineering at Western University, Canada. My research combines cutting-edge computational techniques with physical insight to explore material behavior at atomic and microstructural scales. My current focus is on understanding the deformation mechanisms, damage evolution, and failure processes in TRISO nuclear fuel materials, particularly at elevated temperatures.
      </p>
      <p>
        I completed my Ph.D. in Materials Science and Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur, where I investigated the sintering and deformation behavior of Fe-Ni alloys through a combination of powder metallurgy, mechanical testing, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Prior to that, I obtained my M.Tech in Metallurgical and Materials Engineering from the National Institute of Technology (NIT) Rourkela, where I worked on intermetallic systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        My expertise lies in molecular dynamics simulations (LAMMPS), interface mechanics, dislocation modeling, texture evolution, nanoindentation, and multiphysics coupling. I am also interested in the application of machine learning and crystal plasticity finite element modeling (CPFEM) in materials research.

        <h3>TRISO Fuel Interface Mechanics</h3>
        <p>
          Simulation of deformation behavior at interfaces in TRISO fuel particles, particularly IPyC–SiC and Buffer–PyC layers. This work combines large-scale MD simulations and in-situ nanoindentation experiments to evaluate crack initiation and dislocation activity at high temperatures (~800°C).

      <div class="project">
        <h3>Molecular Dynamics of SiC Polytypes</h3>
        <p>
          Explored dislocation-mediated plasticity and mechanical anisotropy in 3C, 4H, and 6H SiC polytypes using MD simulations under various loading conditions. These studies are critical for optimizing SiC as a barrier layer in nuclear fuel applications.
        </p>

      <div class="project">
        <h3>Sintering and Rolling of Fe–Ni Alloys</h3>
        <p>
          Investigated the microstructural evolution, texture formation, and mechanical response of sintered Fe36Ni alloys subjected to hot and cold rolling along different strain paths. Work included experimental characterization (SEM, EBSD, XRD) and MD simulations of grain-scale deformation.
        </p>

      <div class="project">
        <h3>Ti–Ni–Fe Intermetallic Systems</h3>
        <p>
          Studied the high-temperature behavior of multiphase intermetallic compounds in the Ti–Ni–Fe system. Characterization involved hardness testing, SEM/EDS, and phase stability modeling to evaluate potential structural applications in extreme environments.
